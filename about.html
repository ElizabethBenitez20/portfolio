            <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
              I was born on June 20, 2001, I am 22 years old and I am of
              Argentine nationality, but I currently reside in the city of San
              Ignacio Misiones, Paraguay.
              <br />
              Since I was little I have been familiar with the world of
              computers, I studied office automation when I was 9 years old, and
              I was always curious to know how programs, applications, etc. were
              made. and what was behind them.
              <br />
              At the age of 14, I completed my technical baccalaureate with an
              emphasis on computer science, which lasted 3 years. After that I
              decided to study computer engineering, in which I am in the
              process of writing a thesis in order to receive my professional
              degree.
              <br />
              Thanks to the SheCodes foundation, I am currently able to
              participate in their programming workshops, of which I feel very
              satisfied and happy to be able to live this experience, which I am
              sure will help me train and improve myself professionally.
